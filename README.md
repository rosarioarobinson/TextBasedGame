# TextBasedGame

Created a text-based game for my IT 140 course at Southern New Hampshire University. This game helped to understand the fundamentals of programming in the Python language while using and understanding data types, variables, loops, functions, and lists. 

This text-based game is written in Python using the PyCharm IDE. 

Storyboard description: 
My theme is a treasure hunt adventure game that is based in a mansion. The goal of the game is to find the hidden treasure in each room while avoiding the monster lurking in the library. My game has a total of eight rooms: the great hall, the kitchen, the library, the cellar, the bedroom, the dining room, the living room, and lastly the office. Each room, excluding the great the hall and the library, has a hidden treasure in them. Each treasure item is a silver sword, a magical compass, a gold necklace, an ancient book, a shiny medallion, and a ruby ring. The villain is a creepy monster that is located in the library and must be avoided at all costs.
